  -  we hypothesized that ABA antagonizes a positive GA signal for precocious germination in maize
  -  In these experiments, we show that a GA deficiency early in seed development, induced genetically or via biosynthesis inhibitors, suppresses vivipary in ABA-deficient developing kernels
  -  We speculate that these GAs stimulate a developmental program leading to vivipary in the absence of normal amounts of ABA and that a reduction of GA content re-establishes an ABA/GA ratio appropriate for suppression of germination and induction of maturation.

  - Nine plant hormones in developing seeds of field grown wheat varities
  - Spikes were tagged at anthesis and were harvested at 5-day intervals from 30 to 60 days post-anthesis (DPA)
  - Water contents and dry weights of seeds were examined
  - Germinability and plant hormone contents were ascertained when the water content was below 20%
  - Germinability of seeds and effects of exogenous ABA (Moistened wtih 6ml distillted water or ABA solution incubated at 20 c for 14 days followed by measure GI
  - Quantification of plant hormones in whole seeds (hormones quantified by LC-ESI-MS/MS)
  - Quantification of plant hormones in dissected tissues of seeds (Disect the seeds and lyophlilized wheat seeds)

  - Trees were randomly chosen for the ABA spray experiment of an individual repeat
  - Four different treatment were performed to branches of each tree (I) Control: 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20; (II) 40 μM ABA in 0.5% (v/v) Tween-20 (the same on other treatments); (III) 200 μM ABA and (IV) 500 μM ABA
  - Once per week continously for 6 weeks.

  - DNA methylation affected not only fruit ripening but also the growth of viviparous seedling within the cnr(colorless non ripening) fruits
  - spontaneous epimutation that causes hypermethylation in the promoter of CNR, agene that encodes that SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein box TF SPL-CNR
