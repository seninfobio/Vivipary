  -  we hypothesized that ABA antagonizes a positive GA signal for precocious germination in maize
  -  In these experiments, we show that a GA deficiency early in seed development, induced genetically or via biosynthesis inhibitors, suppresses vivipary in ABA-deficient developing kernels
  -  We speculate that these GAs stimulate a developmental program leading to vivipary in the absence of normal amounts of ABA and that a reduction of GA content re-establishes an ABA/GA ratio appropriate for suppression of germination and induction of maturation.
